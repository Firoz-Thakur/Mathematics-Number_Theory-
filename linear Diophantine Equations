A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integral solutions are required. An Integral solution is a solution such 
that all the unknown variables take only integer values.

Given three integers a, b, c representing a linear equation of the form : ax + by = c. Determine if the equation has a solution such that x and y are both integral values.\


int isPossible(int A, int B, int C){
        // code here
    if(C%__gcd(A,B)==0)
     return 1;
    else
     return 0;
        
    }
    
    
    int isPossible(int A, int B, int C){
        // code here
    if(C%__gcd(A,B)==0)
    {
     extended(A,B);           //for the solutions
     return 1;
    }
    else
     return 0;
        
    }
