sum of AP= n/2(2*a+(n-1)d);
nth term in a AP= a+(n-1)d;

sum of GP = a(1-r^n)/1-r;
nth term of GP = ar^n-1;

Quadratics equation :

D>1 = distinct roots.
D=0 = equal roots.
D<1 = imajinary roots.

Prime Number :
 
note : 1) every prime number can be represented in the form of 6n+1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3 where n is natural number (n=1,2,3,4,5,5.....)
 2) 2 and 3 are only two consecutive prime number
